                    "text": "Clinical genetic testing of protein-coding regions identifies a likely causative variant in only around half of developmental disorder (DD) cases. The contribution of regulatory variation in non-coding regions to rare disease, including DD, remains very poorly understood. We screened 9,858 probands from the Deciphering Developmental Disorders (DDD) study for de novo mutations in the 5' untranslated regions (5' UTRs) of genes within which variants have previously been shown to cause DD through a domit haploinsufficient mechanism. We identified four single-nucleotide variants and two copy-number variants upstream of MEF2C in a total of ten individual probands. We developed multiple bespoke and orthogonal experimental approaches to demonstrate that these variants cause DD through three distinct loss-of-function mechanisms, disrupting transcription, translation, and/or protein function. These non-coding region variants represent 23% of likely diagnoses identified in MEF2C in the DDD cohort, but these would all be missed in standard clinical genetics approaches. Nonetheless, these variants are readily detectable in exome sequence data, with 30.7% of 5' UTR bases across all genes well covered in the DDD dataset. Our analyses show that non-coding variants upstream of genes within which coding variants are known to cause DD are an important cause of severe disease and demonstrate that analyzing 5' UTRs can increase diagnostic yield. We also show how non-coding variants can help inform both the disease-causing mechanism underlying protein-coding variants and dosage tolerance of the gene.",

In AOM/DSS-induced colitis-associated colorectal cancer, the deficiency of Adamts18 in mice resulted in enhanced tumorigenesis and colon inflammation that could be attributed in part to enhanced nuclear translocation of \u03b2-catenin and elevated expression of its downstream target genes, cyclin D1 and c-myc. Moreover, increased p38MAPK and ERK1/2 activities were detected in colon cancer cells from Adamts18-deficient mice. Further studies revealed that ADAMTS18 deficiency reduced intestinal E-cadherin levels in mice, which ultimately led to intestinal barrier dysfunction. These data indicate that Adamts18 deficiency enhances tumorigenesis and intestinal inflammation through elevated Wnt/\u03b2-catenin and p38MAPK/ERK1/2 signaling and promotes colon cancer in this mouse model.",

The X-linked FHF2 gene (also known as FGF13) has alternative first exons which produce multiple protein isoforms that differ in their N-terminal sequence. The variants were located at highly conserved residues in the FHF2A inactivation particle that competes with the intrinsic fast inactivation mechanism of Nav channels. Functional characterization of mutant FHF2A co-expressed with wild-type Nav1.6 (SCN8A) revealed that mutant FHF2A proteins lost the ability to induce rapid-onset, long-term blockade of the channel while retaining pro-excitatory properties. These gain-of-function effects are likely to increase neuronal excitability consistent with the epileptic potential of FHF2 variants. Our findings demonstrate that FHF2 variants are a cause of infantile-onset developmental and epileptic encephalopathy and underline the critical role of the FHF2A isoform in regulating Nav channel function.",

OR downregulation likely represents a non-cell autonomous effect, since SARS-CoV-2 detection in OSNs is extremely rare both in human and hamster OEs. A likely explanation for the reduction of OR transcription is the striking reorganization of nuclear architecture observed in the OSN lineage, which disrupts multi-chromosomal compartments regulating OR expression in humans and hamsters. Our experiments uncover a novel molecular mechanism by which a virus with a very selective tropism can elicit persistent transcriptional changes in cells that evade it, contributing to the severity of COVID-19.",

This drug is designed to skip exon 45 during pre-mRNA splicing, allowing for the production of a truncated but functional form of dystrophin protein. Clinical trials have shown that casimersen can increase dystrophin levels in patients with DMD, which may lead to improved muscle function and delayed disease progression.

                "Casimersen is an antisense oligonucleotide drug designed to treat Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) in patients with specific genetic mutations. It works by promoting exon 45 skipping during the pre-mRNA splicing process, which allows for the production of a partially functional dystrophin protein, essential for muscle function. The effectiveness of casimersen was demonstrated in a phase 3 clinical trial called ESSENCE (NCT02500381), which evaluated its safety and efficacy in DMD patients amenable to exon 45 skipping. In February 2021, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted accelerated approval to casimersen (brand name Amondys 45) based on an increase in dystrophin production observed in skeletal muscle biopsies from treated patients. While this surrogate endpoint is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, confirmatory trials are needed to verify the drug's impact on motor function and other clinically meaningful outcomes. Overall, casimersen has shown promise as a treatment option for DMD patients with specific genetic mutations; however, further research is required to establish its long-term benefits and safety profile.",

                "Eteplirsen (brand name Exondys 51) is an FDA-approved drug for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) in patients with a confirmed mutation amenable to exon 51 skipping. DMD is a rare genetic disorder characterized by progressive muscle degeneration and weakness, caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene. Eteplirsen works by promoting the skipping of exon 51 during mRNA processing, allowing for the production of a truncated but partially functional dystrophin protein.\n\nThe approval of eteplirsen was based on a small clinical trial that demonstrated an increase in dystrophin levels in treated patients. However, its clinical efficacy has been a subject of debate due to limited data on long-term functional outcomes. Some studies have reported modest improvements or stabilization in motor function, while others have not observed significant benefits. The FDA has required further clinical trials to confirm eteplirsen's effectiveness.\n\nIn summary, eteplirsen is approved for treating DMD patients with specific genetic mutations, but its overall effectiveness remains controversial. While it has shown potential in increasing dystrophin levels, more robust evidence from larger clinical trials is needed to conclusively establish its impact on long-term functional outcomes and quality of life for DMD patients.",

It works by binding to a specific region of the DMD gene, allowing the cellular machinery to skip over exon 53 during mRNA processing and produce a truncated but partially functional dystrophin protein. The FDA granted accelerated approval for golodirsen in December 2019 based on an increase in dystrophin production observed in skeletal muscle biopsies from treated patients. However, the clinical benefit of golodirsen, such as improved motor function, has not been definitively established. Ongoing clinical trials are evaluating its long-term efficacy and safety profile. It is important to note that golodirsen is only applicable to a subset of DMD patients with mutations amenable to exon 53 skipping, which represents approximately 8% of the DMD population. In summary, golodirsen shows promise for treating DMD in a specific group of patients by increasing dystrophin production; however, further studies are needed to confirm its long-term effectiveness and safety.",

(2016) demonstrated that deflazacort was associated with a slower decline in muscle strength and function compared to prednisone, suggesting a potential advantage for deflazacort. However, other studies have reported no significant differences in efficacy between the two drugs. It is important to note that deflazacort may have a more favorable side effect profile, with reduced weight gain and less impact on linear growth compared to prednisone/prednisolone. In conclusion, while there is some evidence suggesting that deflazacort might be more efficient than prednisone/prednisolone in treating DMD, the overall data remains inconclusive.

DMD is a severe, progressive muscle-wasting disorder caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene. Viltolarsen works by promoting exon 53 skipping, which allows for the production of partially functional dystrophin protein in patients with amenable mutations. In a phase 2 clinical trial (NCT02740972), viltolarsen demonstrated significant improvements in dystrophin expression and motor function compared to placebo. Based on these results, viltolarsen received accelerated approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in August 2020 under the brand name Viltepso for DMD patients amenable to exon 53 skipping therapy. However, it is important to note that this approval was based on surrogate endpoints, and further studies are needed to confirm its long-term efficacy and safety profile. Overall, viltolarsen appears to be a promising treatment option for specific subsets of DMD patients but requires additional research to fully establish its therapeutic potential.",

The anti-HBs level in the therapeutic paracetamol group (4958 mIU/mL) was not different (p = 0.34) from the level in the control group. Only prophylactic paracetamol treatment, and not therapeutic treatment, during vaccination has a negative influence on the antibody concentration after hepatitis B vaccination in adults.

Stopping them may worsen asthma or COPD control and thereby increase the risk for complications of COVID-19.",

A meta-analysis found no significant difference in the risk for severe or fatal COVID-19 outcomes between patients who used ICS and those who did not. In fact, evidence from clinical studies suggests that ICS may have a protective role in preventing severe COVID-19 and could be a promising treatment for the disease. Additionally, patients with asthma who were regularly using ICS at home had significantly shorter hospital stays compared to those without treatment. Therefore, it is recommended that patients continue to use ICS as prescribed by their healthcare provider to maintain control of their respiratory symptoms and potentially reduce the severity of COVID-19 if they contract the virus."

Music can provide an emotional release which may help children feel more comfortable but there is little evidence to suggest that it directly reduces pain levels in infants. It's important to use treatments based on scientific research rather than subjective beliefs, and further studies are needed to fully understand how music affects infant development and wellbeing.\"",

Despite these positive findings, more research is needed to confirm whether music therapy is truly beneficial in all cases.",

Several studies have investigated the effectiveness of music therapy in reducing pain and distress during painful procedures such as heel stick, venipuncture, and circumcision. A systematic review and meta-analysis of 11 randomized controlled trials found that music therapy was associated with a significant reduction in pain scores compared to standard care or no intervention. The effect size was moderate, suggesting that music therapy can be an effective adjunctive intervention for pain management in neonates. However, the optimal type, timing, and duration of music therapy interventions are still unclear. Further research is needed to determine the most effective approach to implementing music therapy for neonatal pain management.",
                "Music therapy has been shown to have beneficial effects on the health of preterm infants in neonatal intensive care units, particularly for physiological and behavioral outcomes. However, a study examining the effect of music intervention on neonatal stress response to venepuncture in preterm infants did not find any additional benefit. Another study found that breastfeeding could significantly reduce pain response in healthy-term neonates during heel lance, but music therapy did not enhance the effect of pain relief from breastfeeding. While there is some evidence supporting the use of music therapy for pain management in neonates, further research is needed to fully understand its effectiveness and potential limitations. It may be useful to explore how music therapy can be integrated with other interventions, such as breastfeeding or pharmacological treatments, to optimize pain management in this population.",
                "Music therapy has shown promising results in pain management for neonates. Several studies have demonstrated its effectiveness in reducing pain and stress levels in newborns undergoing various medical procedures. A systematic review by Hartling et al. (2009) found that music therapy, specifically live or recorded lullabies, can lead to significant reductions in heart rate, respiratory rate, and behavioral distress during painful interventions such as heel lance and venipuncture. Another study by Loewy et al. (2013) reported that music therapy reduced the need for analgesic medications and improved vital signs in premature infants receiving intensive care. Additionally, a meta-analysis by van der Heijden et al. (2016) concluded that music intervention significantly decreased pain scores in neonates during minor painful procedures. However, it is important to note that the quality of evidence varies across studies, and more rigorous research is needed to establish optimal protocols for music therapy implementation in neonatal pain management. Overall, current evidence suggests that music therapy can be an effective non-pharmacological intervention for managing pain in neonates when used alongside standard medical care.",
                "Music therapy has shown some beneficial effects on the health of preterm infants in neonatal intensive care units, particularly for physiological and behavioral outcomes (PMID: 34919292). However, its effectiveness in pain management during specific procedures like venepuncture and heel lance is not consistently supported. One study found no additional benefit of music intervention on neonatal stress response to venepuncture in preterm infants (PMID: 31532835). Another study reported that while breastfeeding significantly reduced pain response during heel lance in healthy-term neonates, music therapy did not enhance the effect of pain relief provided by breastfeeding (PMID: 25467598). In summary, although music-based interventions may have some positive effects on preterm infants' overall health, their effectiveness in pain management during specific procedures remains inconclusive. Further research involving music therapists is needed to better understand the potential benefits of music therapy for neonatal pain management."

One study found that breastfeeding was more effective than sucrose solution or swaddling alone in reducing pain scores during heel lance procedures. Another study showed that breastfeeding combined with skin-to-skin contact resulted in lower pain scores and decreased crying time compared to standard care during venipuncture procedures.

The analgesic effect of breastfeeding is attributed to a combination of factors, including the comforting presence of the mother, skin-to-skin contact, and the release of endogenous opioids due to suckling. Additionally, breast milk contains components like lactose and tryptophan that may contribute to its pain-relieving properties. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends breastfeeding or providing expressed breast milk as a non-pharmacological intervention for managing procedural pain in neonates. However, it is essential to consider individual circumstances and consult healthcare professionals before implementing any pain management strategy for newborns.",

Several studies have investigated the relationship between salivary cortisol levels and pain in neonates, with mixed results.

One possible explanation for these discrepancies is that salivary cortisol levels may be influenced by factors other than pain, such as stress or circadian rhythm. Additionally, there are limitations to using salivary cortisol as a pain biomarker, including the need for multiple samples over time and the potential for variability in collection methods. Overall, while salivary cortisol shows promise as a non-invasive method for assessing pain in neonates, further research is needed to fully understand its utility and limitations in this population.",
                "The study observed an increase in salivary cortisol (SC) concentrations in response to painful stimulus, indicating that SC can be used as an objective parameter to assess pain in neonates. The presence of a correlation between Neonatal Infant Pain Scale (NIPS) scores and SC increase further supports this conclusion. Salivary cortisol measurement is non-invasive and has the potential to provide a reliable and valid measure of pain in neonates, which is particularly important given the challenges associated with assessing pain in this population. This finding could have significant implications for clinical practice, as it may lead to improved pain management strategies for neonates. However, further research is needed to validate these findings and determine the optimal use of salivary cortisol measurement in clinical settings.",
                "Salivary cortisol can be used as a non-invasive biomarker to evaluate pain in neonates. Several studies have demonstrated that salivary cortisol levels increase in response to painful stimuli or stressors in newborns, such as heel lance procedures and circumcision. This method offers advantages over traditional pain assessment tools, which often rely on subjective behavioral and physiological indicators that may not accurately reflect the infant's pain experience. Salivary cortisol sampling is easy to collect, minimally invasive, and causes minimal discomfort for the neonate. However, it is important to note that factors like gestational age, time of day, and previous exposure to stressors can influence cortisol levels. Therefore, while salivary cortisol has shown promise as a tool for evaluating neonatal pain, it should be used in conjunction with other established pain assessment methods to ensure accurate evaluation of an infant's pain experience.",
                "Yes, salivary cortisol (SC) can be used to evaluate pain in neonates. A study observed an increase in SC concentrations in response to painful stimuli, and a correlation was found between Neonatal Infant Pain Scale (NIPS) scores and the increase in SC levels. This suggests that SC can serve as an objective parameter for assessing pain in neonates. The use of salivary cortisol as a biomarker for pain assessment offers a non-invasive method that could potentially improve the accuracy and reliability of neonatal pain evaluation."

                "DNA accessibility is thought to be of major importance in regulating gene expression. However, recent studies focusing on the quantitative nature of the accessibility signal reveal subtle differences between active enhancers and their different inactive counterparts: the closed silenced state and the accessible primed and repressed states. While the open structure as such is not a specific indicator of enhancer activity, active enhancers display a higher degree of accessibility than the primed and repressed states. In addition, another study has shown that euchromatin and heterochromatin can have very similar accessibilities, suggesting that transcription factors can penetrate heterochromatin. Together, these results show that many gene expression changes can happen independently of changes in the accessibility of local chromatin.",
                "Accessible enhancers are DNA sequences that can regulate gene expression by binding to transcription factors and promoting the recruitment of RNA polymerase. However, not all accessible enhancers are necessarily active. In fact, recent studies have shown that many accessible enhancers may be in a primed but inactive state, waiting for specific signals or conditions to become fully active. This is supported by evidence showing that some enhancers are only activated under certain cellular contexts or developmental stages. Additionally, it has been observed that some enhancers may be accessible but lack the necessary chromatin modifications or co-factors required for activation. Therefore, while accessibility is a necessary prerequisite for enhancer activity, it does not guarantee it. Further research is needed to better understand the mechanisms underlying enhancer activation and how they contribute to gene regulation in different biological contexts.",

While open chromatin is not a specific indicator of enhancer activity, active enhancers display a higher degree of accessibility than primed and repressed states. However, DNA accessibility is not likely to be the primary determi\"\"t of gene regulation, as euchromatin and heterochromatin have similar accessibilities, suggesting that transcription factors can penetrate heterochromatin. Furthermore, changes in gene expression can occur independently of changes in local chromatin accessibility in the context of a single-factor perturbation. Therefore, while accessible enhancers may be more likely to be active than their closed counterparts, other factors such as transcription factor binding are also important determi\"\"ts of enhancer activity."

                "Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) is a genetic disorder that affects the motor neurons in the spinal cord, leading to muscle weakness and atrophy. SMA is classified into four types based on age of onset, severity, and progression of symptoms. However, recent research has identified additional subtypes of SMA that are not included in the traditional classification system. These subtypes include adult-onset SMA, which typically presents with milder symptoms later in life; congenital SMA, which presents at birth or shortly thereafter and can be more severe than type 1 SMA; and intermediate SMA, which falls between types 2 and 3 in terms of symptom severity and age of onset. Additionally, there are several rare forms of SMA caused by mutations in different genes that can present with unique clinical features. While types 1-4 remain the most commonly recognized forms of SMA, it is important for clinicians to be aware of these additional subtypes as they may require different management strategies and have implications for genetic counseling.",
                "Yes, there are other types of Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) besides types 1-4. One exceptionally rare type of SMA is SMA with Respiratory Distress Type 1 (SMARD1), which affects the respiratory system. Additionally, there have been no convincing reports of X-linked SMA thus far. It is worth noting that in childhood SMA (Type 1), the total AChE activity was either normal or decreased, as it was in other SMA groups and disease controls such as ALS and X-linked SMA. However, further research is needed to fully understand the different types and subtypes of SMA and their underlying mechanisms.",

These include adult-onset SMA, also known as SMA type 5 or Kennedy's disease, which is a rare X-linked recessive neuromuscular disorder caused by mutations in the androgen receptor gene. Another form is distal SMA, which affects the distal muscles of the limbs and can be further classified into several subtypes based on age of onset and inheritance pattern. Additionally, some cases of congenital SMA with arthrogryposis have been reported, characterized by joint contractures present at birth. It is important to note that these rarer forms of SMA may have overlapping clinical features with other neuromuscular disorders, making accurate diagnosis challenging. Genetic testing plays a crucial role in confirming the specific type of SMA and guiding appropriate management strategies for affected individuals.",
                "Yes, there are other types of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) besides the common types 1-4. One such example is spinal muscular atrophy with respiratory distress type 1 (SMARD1), which is an exceptionally rare form of SMA characterized by early-onset respiratory failure and progressive muscle weakness. Although there have been mentions of X-linked SMA in the literature, no convincing reports have been published to confirm its existence. In addition to these, research continues to uncover new genetic mutations and phenotypes associated with SMA, expanding our understanding of this group of neuromuscular disorders."

However, some studies have detected viral RNA in breast milk samples from mothers who have tested positive for COVID-19. It is important to note that the presence of viral RNA does not necessarily mean that the virus is viable or infectious. The World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend that mothers with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 should continue breastfeeding while taking precautions such as wearing a mask and practicing good hand hygiene. Breastfeeding provides numerous benefits to both the mother and infant, including protection against other infections. Ultimately, decisions regarding breastfeeding should be made on a case-by-case basis in consultation with healthcare providers.",
                "According to a recent study involving 110 lactating women, breast milk does not contain infectious SARS-CoV-2 even when the virus's RNA is detected. While the virus can be found infrequently in breast milk after recent infection, there is no evidence that breastfeeding represents a risk factor for transmission of infection to infants. Therefore, recent SARS-CoV-2 infection or detection of its RNA in human milk is not a contraindication to breastfeeding. However, preventive measures should be taken by COVID-19 mothers to prevent droplet transmission of infection to their infants while breastfeeding. Based on the currently available limited evidence and recognizing the benefits of breastfeeding, healthcare providers should encourage direct breastfeeding or extracted breastmilk if the health of the mother and her newborn allows after a careful discussion of the risks of vertical transmission to the mother and her family.",
                "Current evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, is not likely to be transmitted through breast milk. According to studies and case reports, the presence of the virus in breast milk has been rarely detected. The World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend that mothers with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 continue breastfeeding while following appropriate precautions, such as wearing a mask and practicing hand hygiene. Breast milk provides numerous health benefits to infants, including essential nutrients and antibodies that help protect against infections. Additionally, some research indicates that breast milk may contain specific antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, potentially offering some protection to the infant. However, it is important to note that close contact between an infected mother and her baby could still pose a risk of transmission through respiratory droplets. Therefore, it is crucial for mothers with COVID-19 to follow recommended guidelines to minimize the risk of transmission while continuing to provide the benefits of breastfeeding.",

                "In eukaryotes, it is generally assumed that translation initiation occurs at the AUG codon closest to the messenger RNA 5' cap, which codes for methionine; hence, an initial assumption would be that all proteins should contain a methionine at their N-terminus (i.e., start site). However, this is not the case mostly for two reasons. First, in certain cases, initiation can occur at codons differing from AUG, which may still code for methionine (e.g., AGG) or less commonly another amino acid (e.g., GUC coding for valine). Moreover, N-terminal methionine can be cleaved after translation by the enzyme methionine aminopeptidase and this removal can be crucial for the function and stability of the final protein. For these reasons, not all proteins start with methionine at their N-terminus.",
                "Methionine is commonly considered as the first amino acid in most proteins. However, not all proteins start with methionine. In some cases, the initial methionine residue is removed post-translationally by specific enzymes called aminopeptidases. Additionally, alternative translation initiation sites can also lead to the production of protein isoforms that lack the N-terminal methionine residue. Moreover, some proteins have an initiator tRNA that carries a formylated methionine instead of a regular methionine at their N-terminus. This formyl group is usually removed later by deformylases. Therefore, while methionine is often present at the beginning of many proteins, it is not always required for proper protein function or stability.",
                "All proteins do not necessarily start with methionine, but it is common for eukaryotic and archaeal proteins to begin with this amino acid. During the initiation of translation, the first codon in the mRNA sequence is typically an AUG codon, which codes for methionine. This process is facilitated by the initiator tRNA (tRNAi^Met) that carries methionine and recognizes the start codon. However, there are exceptions to this rule. In some cases, alternative start codons such as CUG, GUG, or UUG can be used to initiate translation in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. These alternative start codons usually code for amino acids like leucine or valine instead of methionine. Additionally, post-translational modifications can occur after protein synthesis, leading to the removal of the initial methionine or its modification into another amino acid like acetylated methionine or formylmethionine (fMet), which is commonly found in bacterial proteins. Therefore, while many proteins do initially start with methionine due to the canonical AUG start codon, there are exceptions where alternative initiation events or post-translational modifications result in proteins that do not begin with this amino acid."

We demonstrate that TIAM1 shuttles between the cytoplasm and nucleus antagonizing TAZ/YAP by distinct mechanisms in the two compartments. In the cytoplasm, TIAM1 localizes to the destruction complex and promotes TAZ degradation by enhancing its interaction with \u03b2TrCP. Nuclear TIAM1 suppresses TAZ/YAP interaction with TEADs, inhibiting expression of TAZ/YAP target genes implicated in epithelial-mesenchymal transition, cell migration, and invasion, and consequently suppresses CRC cell migration and invasion. Importantly, high nuclear TIAM1 in clinical specimens associates with increased CRC patient survival. Together, our findings suggest that in CRC TIAM1 suppresses tumor progression by regulating YAP/TAZ activity.",

Modelling of identified mutations showed that they inactivate the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of HUWE1. Genetic deletion of Huwe1 rapidly accelerated tumourigenic in mice carrying loss of the intestinal tumour suppressor gene Apc, with a dramatic increase in tumour initiation. Mechanistically, this phenotype was driven by increased MYC and rapid DNA damage accumulation leading to loss of the second copy of Apc The increased levels of DNA damage sensitised Huwe1-deficient tumours to DNA-damaging agents and to deletion of the anti-apoptotic protein MCL1. Taken together, these data identify HUWE1 as a bona fide tumour suppressor gene in the intestinal epithelium and suggest a potential vulnerability of HUWE1-mutated tumours to DNA-damaging agents and inhibitors of anti-apoptotic proteins.",

In vitro studies have suggested that ADAR3 acts as a negative regulator of A-I RNA editing but the scope and underlying mechanisms are also unknown. Meta-analysis of published data indicates that mouse Adar3 expression is highest in the hippocampus, thalamus, amygdala, and olfactory region. Consistent with this, we show that mice lacking exon 3 of Adar3 (which encodes two double stranded RNA binding domains) have increased levels of anxiety and deficits in hippocampus-dependent short- and long-term memory formation. RNA sequencing revealed a dysregulation of genes involved in synaptic function in the hippocampi of Adar3-deficient mice. We also show that ADAR3 transiently translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus upon KCl-mediated activation in SH-SY5Y cells.

Here, we identified three unrelated multigeneration families with a high level of mtDNA heteroplasmy (ranging from 24 to 76%) in a total of 17 individuals. Heteroplasmy of mtDNA was independently examined by high-depth whole mtDNA sequencing analysis in our research laboratory and in two Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments and College of American Pathologists-accredited laboratories using multiple approaches. A comprehensive exploration of mtDNA segregation in these families shows biparental mtDNA transmission with an autosomal domi\"\"tlike inheritance mode.

The prognostic value of this deletion was validated in two independent series, one consisting of 36 HGSOCs analyzed by fluorescent in situ hybridization (P = 0.04) and another comprised of 411 HGSOCs from the Cancer Genome Atlas study (TCGA) (HR = 0.67, 95%CI = 0.48-0.93, Padj = 0.019). In addition, we confirmed the association of low expression of the genes from the region with longer survival in 799 HGSOCs (HR = 0.74, 95%CI = 0.61-0.90, log-rank P = 0.002) and 675 high-FIGO stage HGSOCs (HR = 0.76, 95%CI = 0.61-0.96, log-rank P = 0.02) available from the online tool KM-plotter. Finally, by integrating copy number, RNAseq and survival data of 296 HGSOCs from TCGA we propose a few candidate genes that can potentially explain the association. Altogether our findings indicate that the 6q24.2-26 deletion is an independent marker of favorable outcome in HGSOCs with potential clinical value as it can be analyzed by FISH on tumor sections and guide the selection of patients towards more conservative therapeutic strategies in order to reduce side-effects and improve quality of life.",

Notably, all of them are affected by global developmental delay with speech impairment and intellectual disability; however, none displayed overt clinical signs of immune deficiency. Six frameshift mutations, two nonsense mutations, one missense mutation, and two chromosomal rearrangements resulting in diminished BCL11B expression, arose de novo. A further frameshift mutation was transmitted from a similarly affected mother. Interestingly, the most severely affected patient harbours a missense mutation within a zinc-finger domain of BCL11B, probably affecting the DNA-binding structural interface, similar to the recently published patient. Furthermore, the most C-terminally located premature termination codon mutation fails to rescue the progenitor cell proliferation defect in hippocampal slice cultures from Bcl11b-deficient mice. Concerning the role of BCL11B in the immune system, extensive immune phenotyping of our patients revealed alterations in the T cell compartment and lack of peripheral type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s), consistent with the findings described in Bcl11b-deficient mice. Unsupervised analysis of 102 T lymphocyte subpopulations showed that the patients clearly cluster apart from healthy children, further supporting the common aetiology of the disorder. Taken together, we show here that mutations leading either to BCL11B haploinsufficiency or to a truncated BCL11B protein clinically cause a non-syndromic neurodevelopmental delay. In addition, we suggest that missense mutations affecting specific sites within zinc-finger domains might result in distinct and more severe clinical outcomes.",

To investigate the molecular basis of TAD formation, we performed Hi-C experiments on cells depleted for the Forkhead transcription factors, Fkh1 and Fkh2, previously associated with replication timing. Forkhead factors do not regulate TAD formation, but do promote longer-range genomic interactions and control interactions between origins near the centromere. Thus, our work defines spatial organization within the budding yeast nucleus, demonstrates the conserved role of genome architecture in regulating DNA replication, and identifies a molecular mechanism specifically regulating interactions between pericentric origins.",

                    "text": "Facing a growing workload and dwindling resources, the US National Library of Medicine (NLM) created the Indexing Initiative project in 1996. This cross-library team's mission is to explore indexing methodologies for ensuring quality and currency of NLM document collections. The NLM Medical Text Indexer (MTI) is the main product of this project and has been providing automated indexing recommendations since 2002. After all of this time, the questions arise whether MTI is still useful and relevant.METHODS: To answer the question about MTI usefulness, we track a wide variety of statistics related to how frequently MEDLINE indexers refer to MTI recommendations, how well MTI performs against human indexing, and how often MTI is used. To answer the question of MTI relevancy compared to other available tools, we have participated in the 2013 and 2014 BioASQ Challenges. The BioASQ Challenges have provided us with an unbiased comparison between the MTI system and other systems performing the same task.RESULTS: Indexers have continually increased their use of MTI recommendations over the years from 15.75% of the articles they index in 2002 to 62.44% in 2014 showing that the indexers find MTI to be increasingly useful. The MTI performance statistics show significant improvement in Precision (+0.2992) and F1 (+0.1997) with modest gains in Recall (+0.0454) over the years. MTI consistency is comparable to the available indexer consistency studies. MTI performed well in both of the BioASQ Challenges ranking within the top tier teams.CONCLUSIONS: Based on our findings, yes, MTI is still relevant and useful, and needs to be improved and expanded. The BioASQ Challenge results have shown that we need to incorporate more machine learning into MTI while still retaining the indexing rules that have earned MTI the indexers' trust over the years. We also need to expand MTI through the use of full text, when and where it is available, to provide coverage of indexing terms that are typically only found in the full text. The role of MTI at NLM is also expanding into new areas, further reinforcing the idea that MTI is increasingly useful and relevant.",

Predicting these MoRFs in disordered protein sequences is a challenging task.METHOD: In this study, we present MoRFpred-plus, an improved predictor over our previous proposed predictor to identify MoRFs in disordered protein sequences. Two separate independent propensity scores are computed via incorporating physicochemical properties and HMM profiles, these scores are combined to predict final MoRF propensity score for a given residue. The first score reflects the characteristics of a query residue to be part of MoRF region based on the composition and similarity of assumed MoRF and flank regions. The second score reflects the characteristics of a query residue to be part of MoRF region based on the properties of flanks associated around the given residue in the query protein sequence. The propensity scores are processed and common averaging is applied to generate the final prediction score of MoRFpred-plus.RESULTS: Performance of the proposed predictor is compared with available MoRF predictors, MoRFchibi, MoRFpred, and ANCHOR. Using previously collected training and test sets used to evaluate the mentioned predictors, the proposed predictor outperforms these predictors and generates lower false positive rate.

Key to their biological function are the molecular recognition features (MoRFs) located within long disordered regions. Computationally identifying these MoRFs from disordered protein sequences is a challenging task. In this study, we present a new MoRF predictor, OPAL, to identify MoRFs in disordered protein sequences. OPAL utilizes two independent sources of information computed using different component predictors. The scores are processed and combined using common averaging method. The first score is computed using a component MoRF predictor which utilizes composition and sequence similarity of MoRF and non-MoRF regions to detect MoRFs. The second score is calculated using half-sphere exposure (HSE), solvent accessible surface area (ASA) and backbone angle information of the disordered protein sequence, using information from the amino acid properties of flanks surrounding the MoRFs to distinguish MoRF and non-MoRF residues.Results: OPAL is evaluated using test sets that were previously used to evaluate MoRF predictors, MoRFpred, MoRFchibi and MoRFchibi-web. The results demonstrate that OPAL outperforms all the available MoRF predictors and is the most accurate predictor available for MoRF prediction.

Development of computational tools for the identification of candidate MoRF locations in amino acid sequences is an important task and an area of growing interest. Given the relative sparseness of MoRFs in protein sequences, the accuracy of the available MoRF predictors is often inadequate for practical usage, which leaves a significant need and room for improvement. In this work, we introduce MoRFCHiBi_Web, which predicts MoRF locations in protein sequences with higher accuracy compared to current MoRF predictors.METHODS: Three distinct and largely independent property scores are computed with component predictors and then combined to generate the final MoRF propensity scores. The first score reflects the likelihood of sequence windows to harbour MoRFs and is based on amino acid composition and sequence similarity information. It is generated by MoRFCHiBi using small windows of up to 40 residues in size. The second score identifies long stretches of protein disorder and is generated by ESpritz with the DisProt option. Lastly, the third score reflects residue conservation and is assembled from PSSM files generated by PSI-BLAST. These propensity scores are processed and then hierarchically combined using Bayes rule to generate the final MoRFCHiBi_Web predictions.RESULTS: MoRFCHiBi_Web was tested on three datasets. Results show that MoRFCHiBi_Web outperforms previously developed predictors by generating less than half the false positive rate for the same true positive rate at practical threshold values.",

AZD5153 is a novel BRD4 inhibitor.METHODS: Prostate cancer cells were treated with AZD5153. Cell survival was tested by MTT assay and clonogenicity assay. Cell proliferation was tested by [H3] DNA incorporation assay. Cell apoptosis was tested by caspase-3/-9 activity assay, Histone DNA ELISA assay, Annexin V FACS assay and TUNEL staining assay. Cell cycle progression was tested by propidium iodide (PI) FACS assay. Signaling was tested by Western blotting assay. The nude mice PC-3 xenograft model was applied to test AZD5153's activity in vivo.RESULTS: AZD5153 inhibited proliferation and survival of established and primary prostate cancer cells. AZD5153 induced apoptosis activation and cell cycle arrest in prostate cancer cells. AZD5153 was non-cytotoxic to the prostate epithelial cells. AZD5153 downregulated BRD4 targets (cyclin D1, Myc, Bcl-2, FOSL1 and CDK4) in PC-3 and primary prostate cancer cells. Further studies show that AKT could be the primary resistance factor of AZD5153. Pharmacological inhibition or genetic depletion of AKT induced BRD4 downregulation, sensitizing AZD5153-induced cytotoxicity in PC-3 cells. In vivo, AZD5153 oral administration inhibited PC-3 xenograft tumor growth in nude mice. Its anti-tumor activity was further enhanced with co-treatment of the AKT specific inhibitor MK-2206.CONCLUSION: Together, our results indicate a promising therapeutic value of the novel BRD4 inhibitor AZD5153 against prostate cancer cells.",

Here, we show that the Mcm2-Ctf4-Pol\u03b1 axis facilitates the transfer of parental (H3-H4)2 tetramers to lagging-strand DNA at replication forks. Mutating the conserved histone-binding domain of the Mcm2 subunit of the CMG (Cdc45-MCM-GINS) DNA helicase, which translocates along the leading-strand template, results in a marked enrichment of parental (H3-H4)2 on leading strand, due to the impairment of the transfer of parental (H3-H4)2 to lagging strands. Similar effects are observed in Ctf4 and Pol\u03b1 primase mutants that disrupt the connection of the CMG helicase to Pol\u03b1 that resides on lagging-strand template. Our results support a model whereby parental (H3-H4)2 complexes displaced from nucleosomes by DNA unwinding at replication forks are transferred by the CMG-Ctf4-Pol\u03b1 complex to lagging-strand DNA for nucleosome assembly at the original location.",

Sensitive and accurate detection of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations is crucial for personalized clinical management of individuals affected by breast or ovarian cancer, and for the identification of at-risk healthy relatives. We performed molecular analysis of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes in 898 Greek families, using Sanger sequencing or Next Generation Sequencing for the detection of small insertion/deletion frameshift, nonsynonymous, truncating and splice-site alterations and MLPA for the detection of large genomic rearrangements. In total, a pathogenic mutation was identified in 12.9% of 898 families analyzed. Of the 116 mutations identified in total 9% were novel and 14.7% were large genomic rearrangements. Our results indicate that different types of mutational events in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are responsible for the hereditary component of breast/ovarian cancer in the Greek population. Therefore the methodology used in the analysis of Greek patients must be able to detect both point and small frameshift mutations in addition to large genomic rearrangements across the entire coding region of the two genes.",

Our analysis of 4,227 such genes uncovers surprisingly high genetic variation across human populations. This increased diversity is unlikely to reflect relaxed purifying selection. Remarkably, MAE genes exhibit an elevated recombination rate and an increased density of hypermutable sequence contexts. However, these factors do not fully account for the increased diversity. We find that the elevated nucleotide diversity of MAE genes is also associated with greater allelic age: variants in these genes tend to be older and are enriched in polymorphisms shared by Neanderthals and chimpanzees. Both synonymous and nonsynonymous alleles of MAE genes have elevated average population frequencies. We also observed strong enrichment of the MAE signature among genes reported to evolve under balancing selection. We propose that an important biological function of widespread MAE might be the generation of cell-to-cell heterogeneity; the increased genetic variation contributes to this heterogeneity.",

Thus, identification of novel prognostic and predictive biomarkers is urgently needed. We have used 42 paraffin-embedded HGSOCs, to evaluate the utility of DNA copy number alterations, as potential predictors of clinical outcome. Copy number-based unsupervised clustering stratified HGSOCs into two clusters of different immunohistopathological features and survival outcome (HR = 0.15, 95%CI = 0.03-0.81; Padj = 0.03). We found that loss at 6q24.2-26 was significantly associated with the cluster of longer survival independently from other confounding factors (HR = 0.06, 95%CI = 0.01-0.43, Padj = 0.005). The prognostic value of this deletion was validated in two independent series, one consisting of 36 HGSOCs analyzed by fluorescent in situ hybridization (P = 0.04) and another comprised of 411 HGSOCs from the Cancer Genome Atlas study (TCGA) (HR = 0.67, 95%CI = 0.48-0.93, Padj = 0.019). In addition, we confirmed the association of low expression of the genes from the region with longer survival in 799 HGSOCs (HR = 0.74, 95%CI = 0.61-0.90, log-rank P = 0.002) and 675 high-FIGO stage HGSOCs (HR = 0.76, 95%CI = 0.61-0.96, log-rank P = 0.02) available from the online tool KM-plotter. Finally, by integrating copy number, RNAseq and survival data of 296 HGSOCs from TCGA we propose a few candidate genes that can potentially explain the association. Altogether our findings indicate that the 6q24.2-26 deletion is an independent marker of favorable outcome in HGSOCs with potential clinical value as it can be analyzed by FISH on tumor sections and guide the selection of patients towards more conservative therapeutic strategies in order to reduce side-effects and improve quality of life.",

WASF1, also known as WAVE1, is part of the WAVE complex and acts as a mediator between Rac-GTPase and actin to induce actin polymerization. The three mutations connected by Matchmaker Exchange were c.1516C>T (p.Arg506Ter), which occurs in three unrelated individuals, c.1558C>T (p.Gln520Ter), and c.1482delinsGCCAGG (p.Ile494MetfsTer23). All three variants are predicted to partially or fully disrupt the C-terminal actin-binding WCA domain. Functional studies using fibroblast cells from two affected individuals with the c.1516C>T mutation showed a truncated WASF1 and a defect in actin remodeling. This study provides evidence that de\u00a0novo heterozygous mutations in WASF1 cause a rare form of intellectual disability.",

However, in most cases, they cannot readily cross the human blood-brain-barrier (BBB). Herein, we propose as a therapeutic for PD the small molecule 17-beta-spiro-[5-androsten-17,2'-oxiran]-3beta-ol (BNN-20), a synthetic analogue of DHEA, which crosses the BBB and is deprived of endocrine side-effects. Using the \"weaver\" mouse, a genetic model of PD, which exhibits progressive dopaminergic neurodegeneration in the Substantia Nigra (SN), we have shown that long-term administration (P1-P21) of BNN-20 almost fully protected the dopaminergic neurons and their terminals, via i) a strong anti-apoptotic effect, probably mediated through the Tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) neurotrophin receptor's PI3K-Akt-NF-\u03baB signaling pathway, ii) by exerting an efficient antioxidant effect, iii) by inducing significant anti-inflammatory activity and iv) by restoring Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) levels. By intercrossing \"weaver\" with NGL mice (dual GFP/luciferase-NF-\u03ba\u0392 reporter mice, NF-\u03ba\u0392.GFP.Luc), we obtained Weaver/NGL mice that express the NF-\u03baB reporter in all somatic cells. Acute BNN-20 administration to Weaver/NGL mice induced a strong NF-\u03baB-dependent transcriptional response in the brain as detected by bioluminescence imaging, which was abolished by co-administration of the TrkB inhibitor ANA-12. This indicates that BNN-20 exerts its beneficial action (at least in part) through the TrkB-PI3K-Akt-NF-\u03baB signaling pathway. These results could be of clinical relevance, as they suggest BNN-20 as an important neuroprotective agent acting through the TrkB neurotrophin receptor pathway, mimicking the action of the endogenous neurotrophin BDNF.

To understand the genetic basis of nonsyndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate (NSCL/P) susceptibility, a complex and highly prevalent congenital malformation, we searched for genetic variants with a regulatory role in a disease-related tissue, the lip muscle (orbicularis oris muscle [OOM]), of affected individuals. From 46 OOM samples, which are frequently discarded during routine corrective surgeries on patients with orofacial clefts, we derived mesenchymal stem cells and correlated the individual genetic variants with gene expression from these cultured cells. Through this strategy, we detected significant cis-eQTLs (i.e., DNA variants affecting gene expression) and selected a few candidates to conduct an association study in a large Brazilian cohort (624 patients and 668 controls). This resulted in the discovery of a novel susceptibility locus for NSCL/P, rs1063588, the best eQTL for the MRPL53 gene, where evidence for association was mostly driven by the Native American ancestry component of our Brazilian sample. MRPL53 (2p13.1) encodes a 39S protein subunit of mitochondrial ribosomes and interacts with MYC, a transcription factor required for normal facial morphogenesis. ",

In this study, we investigated the transcriptional levels of 26 representative T-UCRs and determined the regions that were differentially expressed in PC. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that the expression of T-UCR Uc.63+ was increased in PC tissues. MTT assay and wound healing assay revealed that Uc.63+ was involved in cell growth and cell migration. miR-130b was predicted to have binding sites within the Uc.63+ sequence. The expression of miR-130b was significantly disturbed by the overexpression or knockdown of Uc.63+. We also showed that Uc.63+ regulated the expression of MMP2 via miR-130b regulation. Furthermore, overexpression of Uc.63+ increased the expression of AR and its downstream molecule PSA and promoted resistance to docetaxel through AR regulation. In patients treated with docetaxel, the expression of serum Uc.63+ in the docetaxel-resistant patients was higher than that in the docetaxel-sensitive patients (P = 0.011). Moreover, Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the high expression of serum Uc.63+ correlated with a worse prognosis (P = 0.020). These results substantially support the important role that Uc.63+ plays in PC progression by interacting with miR-130b and indicate that Uc.63+ could potentially be a promising serum marker for deciding the best treatment for patients with CRPC.",

The present study was designed to investigate the effects of BNN27 on recognition memory in rats. For this purpose, the novel object task (NOT), a procedure assessing non-spatial recognition memory and the novel location task (NLT), a procedure evaluating spatial recognition memory were used. Intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of BNN27 (3 and 10mg/kg) antagonized delay-dependent deficits in the NOT in the normal rat, suggesting that this DHEA derivative affected acquisition, storage and retrieval of information. In addition, BNN27 (3 and 10mg/kg, i.p.) counteracted the scopolamine [0.2mg/kg, subcutaneously (s.c.)]-induced non-spatial and spatial recognition memory deficits. These findings suggest that BNN27 may modulate different aspects of recognition memory, potentially interacting with the cholinergic system, relevant to cognition.",

We identify 492 AML-specific cell-essential genes, including several established therapeutic targets such as DOT1L, BCL2, and MEN1, and many other genes including clinically actionable candidates. We validate selected genes using genetic and pharmacological inhibition, and chose KAT2A as a candidate for downstream study.

Although highly conserved, the functional properties of promoters with different shapes and the genetic basis of their evolution remain unclear. Here we used natural genetic variation across a panel of 81 Drosophila lines to measure changes in transcriptional start site (TSS) usage, identifying thousands of genetic variants affecting transcript levels (strength) or the distribution of TSSs within a promoter (shape). Our results identify promoter shape as a molecular trait that can evolve independently of promoter strength. Broad promoters typically harbor shape-associated variants, with signatures of adaptive selection. Single-cell measurements demonstrate that variants modulating promoter shape often increase expression noise, whereas heteroallelic interactions with other promoter variants alleviate these effects. These results uncover new functional properties of natural promoters and suggest the minimization of expression noise as an important factor in promoter evolution.",

We determined the occurrence of SMAD6 variants in all types of craniosynostosis, evaluated the impact of different missense variants on SMAD6 function, and tested independently whether rs1884302 genotype significantly modifies the phenotype.METHODS: We performed resequencing of SMAD6 in 795 unsolved patients with any type of craniosynostosis and genotyped rs1884302 in SMAD6-positive individuals and relatives. We examined the inhibitory activity and stability of SMAD6 missense variants.RESULTS: We found 18 (2.3%) different rare damaging SMAD6 variants, with the highest prevalence in metopic synostosis (5.8%) and an 18.3-fold enrichment of loss-of-function variants comparedwith gnomAD data (P\u2009<\u200910-7). Combined with eight additional variants, \u226520/26 were transmitted from an unaffected parent but rs1884302 genotype did not predict phenotype.CONCLUSION: Pathogenic SMAD6 variants substantially increase the risk of both nonsyndromic and syndromic presentations of craniosynostosis, especially metopic synostosis.

Whole-genome sequencing of clonal organoids before and after this exposure revealed a distinct mutational signature that was absent from organoids injected with isogenic pks-mutant bacteria.

Functional tests were performed to study their pathogenicity and understand the disease mechanism.RESULTS: The consistent clinical features of the affected individuals, from seven unrelated families, included choanal atresia, athelia or hypoplastic nipples, branchial sinus abnormalities, neck pits, lacrimal duct anomalies, hearing loss, external ear malformations, and thyroid abnormalities. None of the individuals had intellectual disability. The frequency of clinical features, objective software-based facial analysis metrics, and genome-wide peripheral blood DNA methylation patterns in these patients were significantly different from that of KS1. Circular dichroism spectroscopy indicated that these MVs perturb KMT2D secondary structure through an increased disordered to \u0251-helical transition.CONCLUSION: KMT2D MVs located in a specific region spanning exons 38 and 39 and affecting highly conserved residues cause a novel multiple malformations syndrome distinct from KS1. Unlike KMT2D haploinsufficiency in KS1, these MVs likely result in disease through a domi\"\"t negative mechanism.",

The function of the 49 variants was experimentally tested in a novel high-throughput human adipocyte differentiation assay, and nine were found to have reduced activity in the assay. Carrying any of these nine LOF variants was associated with a substantial increase in risk of T2D (OR = 7.22; P = 0.005). The combination of large-scale DNA sequencing and functional testing in the laboratory reveals that approximately 1 in 1,000 individuals carries a variant in PPARG that reduces function in a human adipocyte differentiation assay and is associated with a substantial risk of T2D.",

We used circular dichroism to show secondary structure changes and isothermal titration calorimetry to investigate the impact of variants on adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding. Pathogenicity was further supported by enzymatic assays and mass spectroscopy on recombit protein, patient-derived fibroblasts, plasma, and erythrocytes. Response to supplementation was measured with clinical validated rating scales, electrophysiology, and biochemical quantification.RESULTS: We identified biallelic mutations in PDXK in 5 individuals from 2 unrelated families with primary axonal polyneuropathy and optic atrophy. The natural history of this disorder suggests that untreated, affected individuals become wheelchair-bound and blind. We identified conformational rearrangement in the mutant enzyme around the ATP-binding pocket. Low PDXK ATP binding resulted in decreased erythrocyte PDXK activity and low pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) concentrations. We rescued the clinical and biochemical profile with PLP supplementation in 1 family, improvement in power, pain, and fatigue contributing to patients regaining their ability to walk independently during the first year of PLP normalization.INTERPRETATION: We show that mutations in PDXK cause autosomal recessive axonal peripheral polyneuropathy leading to disease via reduced PDXK enzymatic activity and low PLP. We show that the biochemical profile can be rescued with PLP supplementation associated with clinical improvement. As B6 is a cofactor in diverse essential biological pathways, our findings may have direct implications for neuropathies of unknown etiology characterized by reduced PLP levels.

The tumor-suppressing function of CYLD is associated with its deubiquitinating activity, which maps to the carboxyl-terminal region of the protein. In the present study we evaluated the role of intestinal epithelial CYLD in colitis-associated cancer using a conditional mouse CYLD inactivation model.METHODS: In order to evaluate the role of CYLD in intestinal epithelial carcinogenesis, mice (IEC-Cyld (\u03949) mice) that carry a mutation that eliminates the deubiquitinating domain of CYLD in intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) were generated by crossing Villin-Cre transgenic mice to previously generated mice carrying a loxP-flanked Cyld exon 9 (Cyld (flx9) mice).RESULTS: We found that IEC-Cyld (\u03949) mice did not present spontaneous intestinal abnormalities up to one year of age. However, upon challenge with a combination of genotoxic (AOM) and pro-inflammatory (DSS) agents we found that the number of adenomas in the IEC-Cyld (\u03949) mice was dramatically increased compared to the control mice. Inactivation of CYLD in intestinal epithelial cells did not affect the classical nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-\u03baB) and c-Jun kinase (JNK) activation pathways under physiological conditions, suggesting that these pathways do not predispose CYLD-deficient intestinal epithelia to colorectal cancer development before the onset of genotoxic and/or pro-inflammatory stress.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings underscore a critical tumor-suppressing role for functional intestinal epithelial CYLD in colitis-associated carcinogenesis. CYLD expression and its associated pathways in intestinal tumors may be exploited for future prognostic and therapeutic purposes.",

Similarly, there was no difference in MOCA neurocognitive performance (p-value: 0.75) and in the incidence of DCI (OR: 0.85 95% CI: 0.28-2.59).CONCLUSIONS: Use of Cerebrolysin in addition to standard-of-care management of aneurysmal SAH is safe, well tolerated and feasible.

The identification of cancers with a significant adenosine drive is critical to understand the potential for these molecules. However, it is challenging to measure tumor adenosine levels at scale, thus novel, clinically tractable biomarkers are needed.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We generated a gene expression signature for the adenosine signaling using regulatory networks derived from the literature and validated this in patients. We applied the signature to large cohorts of disease from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and cohorts of immune checkpoint inhibitor-treated patients.RESULTS: The signature captures baseline adenosine levels in vivo (r 2 = 0.92, P = 0.018), is reduced after small-molecule inhibition of A2AR in mice (r 2 = -0.62, P = 0.001) and humans (reduction in 5 of 7 patients, 70%), and is abrogated after A2AR knockout. Analysis of TCGA confirms a negative association between adenosine and overall survival (OS, HR = 0.6, P < 2.2e-16) as well as progression-free survival (PFS, HR = 0.77, P = 0.0000006). Further, adenosine signaling is associated with reduced OS (HR = 0.47, P < 2.2e-16) and PFS (HR = 0.65, P = 0.0000002) in CD8+ T-cell-infiltrated tumors. Mutation of TGF\u03b2 superfamily members is associated with enhanced adenosine signaling and worse OS (HR = 0.43, P < 2.2e-16). Finally, adenosine signaling is associated with reduced efficacy of anti-PD1 therapy in published cohorts (HR = 0.29, P = 0.00012).CONCLUSIONS: These data support the adenosine pathway as a mediator of a successful antitumor immune response, demonstrate the prognostic potential of the signature for immunotherapy, and inform patient selection strategies for adenosine pathway modulators currently in development.",

In combination with high-throughput sequencing, CAGE has revolutionized our understanding of the rules of transcription initiation, led to discovery of new core promoter sequence features, and discovered transcription initiation at enhancers genome-wide. The biggest limitation of CAGE is that even the most recently improved version (nAnT-iCAGE) still requires large amounts of total cellular RNA (5 \u00b5g), preventing its application to scarce biological samples such as those from early embryonic development or rare cell types. Here, we present SLIC-CAGE, a Super-Low Input Carrier-CAGE approach to capture 5' ends of RNA polymerase II transcripts from as little as 5-10 ng of total RNA. This dramatic increase in sensitivity is achieved by specially designed, selectively degradable carrier RNA. We demonstrate the ability of SLIC-CAGE to generate data for genome-wide promoterome with 1000-fold less material than required by existing CAGE methods, by generating a complex, high-quality library from mouse embryonic day 11.5 primordial germ cells.",

This SLIC adaptation of the CAGE protocol minimizes RNA losses by artificially increasing the RNA amount through use of an in vitro transcribed RNA carrier mix that is added to the sample of interest, thus enabling library preparation from ogram-amounts of total RNA (i.e., thousands of cells). The carrier mimics the expected DNA library fragment length distribution, thereby eliminating biases that could be caused by the abundance of a homogenous carrier. In the last stages of the protocol, the carrier is removed through degradation with homing endonucleases and the target library is amplified. The target sample library is protected from degradation, as the homing endonuclease recognition sites are long (between 18 and 27 bp), making the probability of their existence in the eukaryotic genomes very low. The end result is a DNA library ready for next-generation sequencing. All steps in the protocol, up to sequencing, can be completed within 6 days. The carrier preparation requires a full working day; however, it can be prepared in large quantities and kept frozen at -80 \u00b0C. Once sequenced, the reads can be processed to obtain genome-wide single-nucleotide resolution TSSs. TSSs can be used for core promoter or enhancer discovery, providing insight into gene regulation. Once aggregated to promoters, the data can also be used for 5'-centric expression profiling.",

Laboratory studies were carried out in human mCRPC organoid cultures, prostate cancer (PCa) cell lines, and mouse xenograft models. Epigenetic studies were carried out in a rapid autopsy cohort.RESULTS: Dickkopf-1 (DKK1) expression is increased in DNPC relative to prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-expressing mCRPC in the Stand Up to Cancer/Prostate Cancer Foundation discovery cohort (11.2 v 0.28 reads per kilobase per million mapped reads; q < 0.05; n = 117) and in the University of Washington/Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center cohort (9.2 v 0.99 fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads; P < .0001). DKK1 expression can be regulated by activated Wnt signaling in vitro and correlates with activating canonical Wnt signaling mutations and low PSA mRNA in mCRPC biopsies (P < .05). DKK1 hypomethylation was associated with increased DKK1 mRNA expression (Pearson r = -0.66; P < .0001) in a rapid autopsy cohort (n = 7). DKK1-high mCRPC biopsies are infiltrated with significantly higher numbers of quiescent natural killer (NK) cells (P < .005) and lower numbers of activated NK cells (P < .0005). Growth inhibition of the human PCa model PC3 by the anti-DKK1 monoclonal antibody DKN-01 depends on the presence of NK cells in a severe combined immunodeficient xenograft mouse model.CONCLUSION: These results support DKK1 as a contributor to the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment of DNPC. These data have provided the rationale for a clinical trial targeting DKK1 in mCRPC (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03837353).",
